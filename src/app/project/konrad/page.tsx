  overview:
    "During the spring of 2023, I worked at Konrad Group as a contract Product Designer working for a Fortune 500 Automotive Parts enterprise. I collaborated with Konrad's Design Director Fredrick Poulsen and three other designers.\nDuring my time there, I designed a digital Load Sheet feature that speeds up the trailer loading process from workers by allowing flexible input from both smart device scanners and desktop. My time at Konrad involved building out, exploring, and pitching ideas to the senior designers and leadership and syncs with the strategy team.",
