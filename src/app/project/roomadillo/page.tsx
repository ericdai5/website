  overview:
    "From February to Aug 2024, I worked at Roomadillo helping to design and develop a new experience for finding student subleases and housing. I worked onsite and closely with the founders Manas and David. \n Additionally, during my time at Roomadillo, I was hands on with helping to grow the on-the-ground operations. I've visited more than 300 apartments over the course of my time there and developed an understanding on the user needs that shaped my design. My time at Roomadillo involved building out the product and refining ideas with the founders.",
